# Top Stories React App - Backend

This is the backend server for the Top Stories React App, which fetches top stories from the New York Times API and serves them to the front-end application. 

To get started, 
clone the repository, 
install dependencies with `npm install`, and sometimes you would need to install ts-node globally => npm install --save-dev ts-node
start the server with `npm start`. 

The server runs on port 3000, accessible at [http://localhost:3000]. 

For a production build, run `npm run build` followed by `node dist/app.js`. 

Configure environment variables, including your New York Times API key, in a `.env` file in the project root.
